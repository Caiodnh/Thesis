\chapter{Gradings on the Lie Superalgebras of Types \texorpdfstring{$A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $P$ and $Q$}{A, B, C, D, P and Q}}\label{chap:Lie}

% ** Intro to Chapter:

In this chapter we finally complete the task of classifying the group gradings on the Lie superalgebras of types $A$, $C$ and $D$.
The techniques we have developed so far also allow us to recover the gradings on the Lie superalgebras of Type $B$ (achieved in ??), $P$ (??) and $Q$ (??).

Our strategy here is to use the tools from Section \ref{sec:g-hat-action} to transfer the problem to a convenient associative superalgebra with superinvolution, and hence use the results from Chapter \ref{chap:super-inv}.
The choice of this associative superalgebra is obvious for the Lie superalgebras of types $B$, $C$, $D$ and $P$.
For types $A$ and $Q$, the choice is not so clear and it is useful mainly for the gradings of ``Type II'', the ones that do are not restrictions of the associative superalgebras $A$ and $Q$ are naturally related via the definitions given in Section \ref{sec:defi-classical-SA}.
Hence we still need the results of \cref{chap:grd-simple-assc} to have a complete classification.

The following is was observed in [DKH] and the proof in \cite[Lemma 2.1]{BZ06} (see also  \cite[Proposition 1.12]{livromicha})

a generalization of \cite[Proposition 1.12]{livromicha} and the same proof works with the obvious modifications.

\begin{prop}\label{prop:simple-Lie-G-abelian}
    If $L$ is a simple Lie superalgebra and $\Gamma$ is a $G$-grading on $L$ such that $\supp \Gamma$ generates $G$, then $G$ is an abelian group. \qed
\end{prop}
