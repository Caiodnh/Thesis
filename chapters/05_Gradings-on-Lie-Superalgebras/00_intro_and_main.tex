% Gradings on Simple Lie Superalgebras of Series \texorpdfstring{$A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $P$ and $Q$}{A, B, C, D, P and Q}

% ** Intro to Chapter:

In this chapter we present a classification up to isomorphism of group gradings on the simple Lie superalgebras in series $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $P$ and $Q$, except for the ones of type $A(1,1)$. 
We note that gradings for series $B$ were classified in \cite{Helens_thesis}, series $P$ in \cite{paper-MAP} and series $Q$ in \cite{paper-Qn}, but the techniques we have developed here allow us to recover those results. 
We also note that in \cite{paper-MAP} there is a partial classification of gradings for series $A$ (more precisely, the gradings of Types I, I\textsubscript{M} and I\textsubscript{Q} according to our present terminology, see \cref{def:A-Type-I,def:Type-I_M,def:Type-I_Q}). 

\Cref{sec:Aut-Lie-chap} shows that the results about gradings on superinvolution-simple associative superalgebras in \cref{chap:grds-sinv-simple} can be transferred to the corresponding simple Lie superalgebras:
in \cref{ssec:aut-ass-sinv}, we use \cref{thm:iso-abstract-vphi} to compute the well-known automorphism groups of the superinvolution-simple associative superalgebras (\cref{prop:Aut-associative}), and in \cref{ssec:transfer-result-aut} we compare them to the automorphism groups of the classical Lie superalgebras found in \cite{serganova,Pianzola}, allowing us to use the tools in 
\cref{sec:Omega-algebras}
% \cref{sec:g-hat-action}
to transfer our classification results (\cref{cor:transfer-R-vphi-to-L}). 
It follows that gradings (and their isomorphism classes) on the simple Lie superalgebras in series $B$, $C$, $D$ and $P$ correspond to gradings (and their isomorphism classes) on the associative superalgebras $M(m,n)$ with appropriate superinvolutions that we used to define these Lie superalgebras in \cref{sec:simple-algebras}. 
In \cref{sec:grds-osp-and-p}, we give a classification for these series (\cref{thm:last-one-for-P,thm:grds-osp-final}). 
For the simple Lie superalgebras in series $A$ and $Q$, only some gradings come from the simple associative superalgebras $S = M(m,n)$ or $Q(n)$ used to define them, but all gradings come from the superinvolution-simple superalgebras $S \times S\sop$. 
The goal of \cref{sec:grds-A-and-Q} is to present models for all gradings in terms of the Lie superalgebra $S^{(-)}$. 
In \cref{ssec:undoubling}, we give a general procedure to construct these models, and in \cref{ssec:grds-on-A-m-n,ssec:grds-on-Q(n),ssec:grds-on-Ann} we adapt this procedure to the Lie superalgebras of types $A(m,n)$ (for $m\neq n$), $Q(n)$ and $A(n,n)$, respectively (see \cref{thm:final-m-not-n,thm:final-Q(n),thm:final-A(n-n)}). 

As in \cref{chap:super-inv,chap:grds-sinv-simple}, we will assume the group $G$ is abelian. 
We can do this without loss of generality because of the next result, which is a generalization of \cite[Lemma 2.1]{BZ06} or \cite[Proposition 1]{MR2257580} (see also \cite[Proposition 1.12]{livromicha} and its proof, which works in this more general situation, as was observed in \cite{paper-MAP}). 

\begin{prop}\label{prop:simple-Lie-G-abelian}
    Let $L$ be a simple Lie superalgebra endowed with a $G$-grading. 
    Then the subgroup of $G$ generated by the support of $L$ is abelian. \qed
\end{prop}
