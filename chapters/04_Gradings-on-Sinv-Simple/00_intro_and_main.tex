\chapter{Gradings on Superinvolution-simple Associative Superalgebras}
% ** Intro to Chapter:

A superalgebra $R$ with super-anti-automorphism $\vphi$ is said to be \emph{$\vphi$-simple} %(or \emph{$*$-simple})
superideals if the only $\vphi$-invariant of $R$ are $0$ and $R$.
In the case $\vphi$ is a superinvolution, we say that the pair $(R, \vphi)$ is a \emph{superinvolution-simple superalgebra}.
In this section we will review some general results on associative superinvolution-simple superalgebras following \cite{racine}.
After that, we consider $G$-gradings on these superalgebras and relate them with results from the previous sections.
