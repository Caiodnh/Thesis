Lay summary is a short account of research targeted at a general
audience, i.e., its goal is to communicate the research results to a
non-specialist readership. It should fit in one page. 

A lay summary provides a brief description of the research in a less
technical language. It should include 1) background of the study, 2)
rationale and methods, and 3) outcomes. 

The following guidelines are recommended. 

a) Write it in every day English, using shot and clear sentences. 

b) The text should be ordered logically and flow naturally, i.e.,
ideas and concepts should introduced as needed. 

c) Everything here should be expressed in active
voice. Preferentially, in first person. 

d) Positive phrasing. 

e) Aims, objectives and results should be clearly stated. 

f) Whenever possible, provide every day examples. 

g) Use the appropriate tone. This summary's goal is to inform not to
entertain.
