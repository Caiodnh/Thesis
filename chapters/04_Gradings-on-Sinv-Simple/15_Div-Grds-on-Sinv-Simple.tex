\section{Where to put this?}


\begin{ex}
	If we consider the associative superalgebra $Q(1)$ graded by the trivial group $G = \{e\}$, it is a graded division superalgebra.
	In this case $G^\# = \ZZ_2$ and, also, $T = \ZZ_2$.
	Since $Q(1)$ is commutative, $\beta$ is identically $1$.
	By Corollary \ref{cor:Q-no-spuerinv-center}, $Q(1)$ does not admit a superinvolution, but the map $\eta\from \ZZ_2 \to \FF^\times$ given by $\eta (\bar 0) = 1$ and $\eta( \bar 1) = i$ defines a super-anti-automorphism on it.
	Indeed, it is easy to check that $(-1)^{p(a) p(b)} =  \eta(ab) \eta(a)\inv \eta(b)\inv$.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}\label{ex:FZ4-revisited}
	By Example \ref{ex:FZ2xFZ2sop-iso-FZ4}, we have a $\ZZ_4$-grading on $Q(1)\times Q(1)\sop$, which is clearly a division grading.
	The exchange superinvolution preserves degree and is determined by $\eta (\bar 0) = 1$, $\eta (\bar 1) = 1$, $\eta (\bar 2) = -1$ and $\eta (\bar 3) = -1$.
