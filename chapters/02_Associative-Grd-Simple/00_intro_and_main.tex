\chapter{Graded-Simple Associative Superalgebras}\label{chap:grd-simple-assc}

In this chapter, we will review some basic results about graded associative algebras graded by a group $G$.
First we will recall the structure of graded-simple associative algebras with a descending chain condition, following \cite{livromicha}, and then its consequences for finite dimensional $G$-graded graded-simple associative superalgebras, following \cite{paper-MAP} and \cite{Helens_thesis}. 

For the main classification results we will assume that the ground field $\FF$ is algebraically closed and the grading group $G$ is abelian. 
Nevertheless, many results will be presented for arbitrary $\FF$ and $G$. 
Gradings will be classified for the matrix superalgebras $M(m,n)$ and the so called queer superalgebras $Q(n)$. 
In the latter case, we will compare our classification with the one obtained in \cite{paper-Qn} using a different method.
