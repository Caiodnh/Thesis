\chapter{Super-anti-automorphisms on Graded-simple Associative Superalgebras}\label{chap:super-inv}

% ** Intro of the Chapter

The orthosymplectic and the paraplectic Lie superalgebras are defined using a nondegenerate bilinenar form on a superspace.
More specifically, if $\vphi$ is the superadjunction corresponding to this form, then we consider the subsuperalgebra of the general linear Lie superalgebra consisting of the skew elements with respect to $\vphi$ (see Subsection {\tt ??}).

{\tt Mention that we are developing the approach of Elduque (J. of \\Al\-ge\-bra 2010, see also Chapter 2 in Monograph) in the super setting.}

	\item Cite Bahturin and Tvaladze; maybe Tvaladze and Tvaladze;
	\item Cite Bahturin and Shestakov;
	\item Also Carlos G\'omes Ambrose ``On the Lie Structure of the Skew Elements of a simple Superalgebra with Superinvolution''
	\item And Racine's paper on superinvolution simple superalgebras.
	\item Maybe Elduques's \cite{elduqueSuperinv};
	\item How what we are doing is different?
	\item Analogous to Lie over $\RR$ (Adri\'an); not literally using results, but using ideas.
\end{itemize}

The next result has is a generalization of \cite[Proposition 2.49]{livromicha} and the same proof works.

\begin{prop}\label{prop:grd-simple-vphi-abelian}
    Let $R$ be a associative $G$-graded superalgebra such that the support generates $G$. 
    If $R$ is graded simple and admits a degree-preserving super-anti-automorphism, then $G$ is abelian. \qed
\end{prop}

% For the remainder of the chapter, $G$ is a fixed abelian group.

% In this chapter we are going to describe
