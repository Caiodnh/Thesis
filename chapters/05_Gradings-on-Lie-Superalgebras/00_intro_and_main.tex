\chapter{Gradings on the Lie Superalgebras of Types \texorpdfstring{$A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $P$ and $Q$}{A, B, C, D, P and Q}}\label{chap:Lie}

% ** Intro to Chapter:

In this chapter we finally complete the task of classifying the group gradings on the Lie superalgebras of types $A$, $C$ and $D$.
The techniques we have developed so far also allow us to recover the gradings on the Lie superalgebras of Type $B$ (achieved in ??), $P$ (??) and $Q$ (??).

Our strategy here is to use the tools from Section \ref{sec:g-hat-action} to transfer the problem to a convenient associative superalgebra with superinvolution, and hence use the results from Chapter \ref{chap:super-inv}.
The choice of this associative superalgebra is obvious for the Lie superalgebras of types $B$, $C$, $D$ and $P$.
For types $A$ and $Q$, the choice is not so clear and it is useful mainly for the gradings of ``Type II'', the ones that do are not restrictions of the associative superalgebras $A$ and $Q$ are naturally related via the definitions given in Section \ref{sec:defi-classical-SA}.
Hence we still need the results of \cref{chap:grd-simple-assc} to have a complete classification.

The following is was observed in [DKH] and the proof in \cite[Lemma 2.1]{BZ06} (see also  \cite[Proposition 1.12]{livromicha})

a generalization of \cite[Proposition 1.12]{livromicha} and the same proof works with the obvious modifications.

\begin{prop}\label{prop:simple-Lie-G-abelian}
    If $L$ is a simple Lie superalgebra and $\Gamma$ is a $G$-grading on $L$ such that $\supp \Gamma$ generates $G$, then $G$ is an abelian group. \qed

\begin{defi}\label{def:model-grd-M(m-n-0)}
    Let $m, n\in \ZZ_{\geq 0}$, not both zero, with $n$ even. 
    Let $T \subseteq G$ be a finite $2$-elementary subgroup $T \subseteq G$, let $\beta\from T\times T \to \FF^\times$ be a nondegenerate alternating bicharacter, let $g_0 = (\tilde g_0, p_0) \in G^\#$ and let $\kappa_\bz, \kappa_\bo \from G/T \to \ZZ_{\geq 0}$ be maps with finite support such that $|\kappa_\bz| \sqrt{|T|} = m$ and $|\kappa_\bo| \sqrt{|T|} = n$. 
    We choose:
    \newcounter{enumi-all}
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        \item a standard realization $\D$ (see \cref{def:standard-realization}) of a matrix algebra with a division grading associated to $(T,\beta)$;
        \item a total order $\leq$ on $G/T$;
        \item a set-theoretic section $\xi\from G/T \to G$ of the natural homomorphism $G \to G/T$.
        %
        \setcounter{enumi-all}{\value{enumi}}
    \end{enumerate}
    Then, we fix:
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        \setcounter{enumi}{\value{enumi-all}}
        %
        \item $p\from T \to \ZZ_2$ to be the trivial homomorphism; 
        \item $\eta\from T \to \pmone$ to be the map determining to the transposition on $\D$; 
        \item for each $i\in \ZZ_2$, $k_i \coloneqq |\kappa_i|$ and $\gamma_i$ to be the $k_i$-tuple whose entries are the elements $\xi(x) \in G$ for $x\in \supp \kappa_i$, repeated $\kappa_i(x)$ times and following the order given by $\leq$. 
        %
        \setcounter{enumi-all}{\value{enumi}}
    \end{enumerate}
    If $p_0 = \bar 0$, assume that $\kappa_\bz, \kappa_\bo$ are such that, for all $x\in G/T$ and $i \in ZZ_2$:
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        \setcounter{enumi}{\value{enumi-all}}
        %
        \item $\kappa_i(x) = \kappa_i(\tilde g_0\inv x\inv)$;
        \item if $\tilde g_0 x^2 = T$ and $(-1)^i \eta(\tilde g_0 \xi(g)^2) = -1$, then $\kappa_i(x)$ is even.
        %
        \setcounter{enumi-all}{\value{enumi}}
    \end{enumerate}
    If $p_1 = \bar 0$, assume that $\kappa_\bz, \kappa_\bo$ are such that, for all $x\in G/T$:
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
        \setcounter{enumi}{\value{enumi-all}}
        %
        \item $\kappa_\bo (x) = \kappa_\bz (\tilde g_0\inv x\inv)$.
        %
        \setcounter{enumi-all}{\value{enumi}}
    \end{enumerate}
    We define $M^*(T, \beta, \kappa_\bz, \kappa_\bo, p_0)$ to be the graded superalgebra $M^* (T, \beta, \kappa_\bz, \kappa_\bo)$, using the choices for $\D$ and $\gamma_i$ above (see \cref{def:Gamma-T-beta-kappa-even}), endowed with the superinvolution $\vphi$ given by 
    \[
        \vphi(X) \coloneqq \Phi\inv X\stransp \Phi,
    \]
    for all $X \in M(m,n)= M(k_\bz, k_\bo) \tensor \D$, where $\Phi$ is the matrix given by
