{Gradings on Superinvolution-\texorpdfstring{ }{}Simple Associative Superalgebras}\label{chap:grds-sinv-simple}
% ** Intro to Chapter:

The main goal of this chapter is to classify (up to isomorphism) the $G$-gradings on the finite dimensional superinvolution-simple associative superalgebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic different from $2$. 
Not only is
this classification of independent interest, but also, in \cref{chap:Lie} (assuming the characteristic is $0$), it will be translated to a complete classification of $G$-gradings on the Lie superalgebras of series $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $P$ and $Q$, with the sole exception of type $A(1,1)$. 
As in \cref{chap:super-inv}, the term \emph{(super)algebra} will mean \emph{associative (super)algebra} and the grading group $G$ will be assumed abelian (see \cref{prop:grd-simple-vphi-abelian}).

In \cref{grd-sinv-simple}, we consider more general objects: graded-superinvolution-simple superalgebras, and show that they are either graded-simple or of the form $S\times S\sop$, with exchange superinvolution, where $S$ is graded-simple (\cref{prop:only-SxSsop-is-simple}). 
The former case was already classified in \cref{chap:super-inv} (\cref{thm:vphi-iff-vphi0-and-B,thm:iso-abstract-vphi,thm:iso-(R-vphi)-with-parameters}), so we complete the classification in the latter case (\cref{lemma:iso-SxSsop,thm:iso-D-even-ExEsop,thm:iso-D-odd-ExEsop,thm:iso-D-odd-ExEsop-unsharp}). 
In \cref{sec:sinv-simple}, we specialize to trivial $G$ and obtain the well-known classification of superinvolution-simple associative superalgebras, which are of the following $3$ types: $M$, $M\times M\sop$ and $Q\times Q\sop$ (see \cref{defi:types-sinv-simple}). 

The gradings on superinvolution-simple superalgebras of type $M$ are classified in \cref{sec:vphi-grds-on-type-M} (\cref{thm:osp-and-p-associative}). 
For superalgebras of types $M\times M\sop$ and $Q\times Q\sop$, we first develop a way to construct division gradings, in \cref{sec:model-O}, and then use them to classify all gradings, in \cref{sec:MxM-and-QxQ-associative}: 
\cref{thm:MxM-type-I,thm:QxQ-type-I} consider the gradings on the superalgebras of types $M\times M\sop$ and $Q\times Q\sop$ that do not make them graded-simple, whereas  
\cref{thm:MxM-even,thm:MxM-odd} consider the remaining gradings. 
The latter theorem deals with the case of odd gradings and gives a classification in terms of $G^\#$, so we derive
\cref{cor:QxQ-reduced-to-MxM,cor:MxMsop-odd-only-G} to express it in terms of $G$. 
A description of gradings for types $M\times M\sop$ and $Q\times Q\sop$ (assuming that $G$ is finite and $\Char \FF$ does not divide $|G|$) was obtained in \cite[Theorems 4 and 5]{BTT} using a different method, which, however, does not lend itself to a classification up to isomorphism. 
We note that elementary gradings on superinvolution-simple superalgebras of type $M$ were described in \cite[Theorems 5.2 and 5.3]{TT}, but the description of general gradings in this preprint is incorrect.  

% In this section we will review some general results on associative superinvolution-simple superalgebras following \cite{racine}.
% After that, we consider $G$-gradings on these superalgebras and relate them with results from the previous sections.

% As noted in \cref{chap:super-inv} (see \cref{prop:grd-simple-vphi-abelian}), we can restrict ourselves to the case $G$ is an abelian group.
